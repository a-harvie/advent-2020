# ADVENT OF CODE

Just making a mess mostly.

# Day 1

Tried this out in [Darklang](https://darklang.com), but it ended up being a bit of a mess. Partially because I haven't worked in any functional paradigm for a while, partially because it's not really intended for this sort of hacky thing.

I did manage to time it out with my naive O(nÂ²) implementation though.
